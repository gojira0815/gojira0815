### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am gojira0815 and I am currently learning how to use GitHub. This is the start of my game development career and learning how to use this would be beneficial. I am interested in creating an FPS game or a 2D platformer game. This would help advance my interests in game dev. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on generating game ideas for my next game.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use GitHub.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a FPS game.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with this new FPS game.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like the color teal. I also really like Godzilla, hence the name gojira.
